# Project-Title 
Library Manegement System .

# Project Description 
- This is a Library Management System __simulation__ , that you can add book to the library 
or you can remove , borrow or return a book.

- The project was implemented using c++ , as an application for studying c/c++ , started to get
hands on excperience on what I've learned so far .

- The project contains 7 files :
  - book.h / book.cpp those files includes getter and setter functions for Title , author , ISBN of the book , also it contains the availabilty of books.
  
  - record.h / record.cpp those files contains vector for holding books to apply any functionality on them including deleting,adding,editing,displaying book by any member function .
  
  - borrow.h / borrow.cpp those files include the functionalities of returning and borrowing a book also the availabilty of a books to be borrowed or not.
  
  - main.cpp this file is utilizes what's in the other 4 files .

- The project can be enhanced in the future adding some features as:
  - Fine management: Implementing a feature to manage fines for overdue books, damaged books, or other penalties can enhance the library management system. This can involve calculating fines based on defined rules, tracking and updating fines for borrowers, and generating reports for fines collected.
  
  - Reservation and hold system: Implementing a reservation and hold system that allows users to reserve books that are currently checked out or on hold can enhance the user experience. This can involve managing reservation queues, notifications for available books, and automated book holds.
  
  - Integration with external systems: Integrating the library management system with external systems such as online catalog databases, book recommendation APIs, or online payment gateways can enhance the functionality and usability of the system.
